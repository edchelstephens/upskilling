# Amazon Machine Image(AMI)
- Operating system and sfotware used on an EC2 instance
- An image is a combination of an operating system and
some preinstalled applications, typically things like Java, Python or the AWS CLI tools.
- Once an instance is created with an image, Amazon won't be updating that instance's software. You need to manually do it yourself.
- AWS only updates the images
