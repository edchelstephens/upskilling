# Route 53
- Amazon's service for DNS management, both insed and outside of AWS
- It allows you to easliy configure domain names to resolve to internal AWS services.
- works by first setting up a hosted zone
- A "hosted" zone is basically a root domain name, like example.com, google.com, djangoboys.dev etc
- you can use Route53 to setup subdomains like www.example.com or mail.example.com and configure them to route to AWS resources

# Domain Name System(DNS)
- System that translates human-readable URLs to IP addresses
