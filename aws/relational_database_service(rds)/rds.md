# Relational Database Service
- a collection of AWS services for **managed** relational databases
- "managed" because AWS takes care of all the backups,
software updates and infrastructure for the database
- uses an ec2 instance in which the relational database runs on
- since this is managed, you can quickly 
    1. take snapshots of your data
    2. increase the size of the ec2 instance being used to back t he database
