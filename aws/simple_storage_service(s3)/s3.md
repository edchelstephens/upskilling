# Simple Storage Service(S3)
- a service that stores files
- s3 is sort of a catch-all service used by other services in AWS like CloundWatch and ElasticBeanstalk, etc.
- it is widely used throughout AWS as the place to store files.
- Can store any type of file, max size is 5 TB
- largest file size that you can upload in single put operation is is 5GB

# S3 Bucket
- the foundational structure in S3
- the root resource to which you can add, delete or modify objects
- it can:
    - trigger events when objects are added/modified/deleted
    - preserve versions of objects
    - replicate objects across regions
- once created, buckets are assigned urls to which you can access the objects contained within them
example:
    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/okfido.org/okfido_logo.png
where:
    s3-us-west-1 -> bucket region
    okfido.org -> bucket name
    okfido_logo.png -> object name
