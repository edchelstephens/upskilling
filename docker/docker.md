# Docker Technology

- from Docker Inc, previously dotCloud for aws but then by 2013 things needed to change for them so they brought out this internal tool they are using for the services, and here comes docker, the dock worker, whale we all love and want

# docker

- the name comes from a British colloquialism that's a conjunction of dock and worker
- somebody who works in a doc or a shipping port is a docker

- Docker provides the mechanics for starting, stopping and deleting containers
