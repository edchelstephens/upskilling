# Containers

- in a way, containers are virtualization 2.0
- they improve on nearly everything offered by hypervisors
- they pave the way for more modern cloud native and microservices applications
- don't expect containers to replace virtual machines, not entirely
- in a lot of cases, containers and virtual machines live side by side.

# Containers are like fast lightweight virtual machines

# and Docker makes running our apps inside of containers really easy
