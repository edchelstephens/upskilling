# monstrous apps where everything the app does is pretty much wrapped in a "single binary"

- "single binary" or "binary" is just a fancy name for a "computer program"

# The essence of microservices and cloud native

- Build, deploy and manage apps in a way that lends itself to modern business requirements or cloud computing requirements, as we often call them.
- It isn't really anything to do with deploying on the cloud.
- You can absolutely run a cloud native app in your on-premise data center
- Cloud native is all about how the app's built and managed, so we can do things
  like scale the front end independent of the back end. You can iterate on the feature
  independently, this is what it means to be cloud native.
